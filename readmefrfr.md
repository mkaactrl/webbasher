# Webbasher

A collection of cursed, chaotic, and crash-heavy code for Websim.  
If it loads, it explodes.

## 🔥 What’s Inside

- 💥 DOM spam & overflowers
- 🌀 Infinite loop attacks
- 🎨 CSS abusers
- 🎭 Glitchy visuals
- 🧪 Web experiments that probably shouldn’t exist

> **WARNING:** These scripts may crash or lag Websim. Use responsibly. Or don’t. I’m not your dev dad.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open Websim (you know the one).
2. Paste/run the code snippets or upload the files.
3. Sit back and watch it melt.
